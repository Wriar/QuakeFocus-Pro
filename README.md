QuakeFocus strong-motion monitoring application and issue tracking

> This project is not yet completed, this text will be removed once the finished product has been uploaded.

## About:
This application is written in a BASIC language so others can read and develop off this framework. It is easily converted to ``C#`` projects and is developed under the ``.NET`` environment for Windows PCs. It can send and receive webhooks and is very customizable. There is a development ``C#`` repository, however, that is private. 

User configuration files can be edited in a text editor or editing within the application setting pane itself.
